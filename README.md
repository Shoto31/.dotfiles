# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are the customization files (their filenames usually begin with a period) that are used to personalize your linux or other Unix-based system. This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may change distros or even change window managers.

| [Awesome](https://github.com/Shoto31/Dotfiles/tree/main/.config/awesome)| [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Shoto31/Dotfiles/tree/main/.config/awesome)|
